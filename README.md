# Eli's Python Practice Repo

I write small and sometimes standalone Python 3.13+ scripts to practice programming, often around vision science and linear algebra. This repo is a lightweight, cross-device base for those scripts (see `scripts/linalg/` and `scripts/others/`); run any file directly, e.g., 

```bash
python scripts/others/temp_convert.py
```
